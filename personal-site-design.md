What is your sites main purpose? 
To keep a journal of my Web Development journey with Dev Academy.  A place where I can visit to reflect on work I have previously done and learnt.    


Who is your target audience?
Currently, my audience is myself and others in my cohort.  In the future I expect it to be potential employers. 

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site?  What experience would your like them to have? 
I would like to showcase a clean site with easy to follow navigation, while still trying to demonstrate my web development skill set. 

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
Clean design with minimal elements on the page.  Responsive design with a mobile first approach.
